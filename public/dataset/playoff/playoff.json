        "Consider a playoff tournament where 2n athletes compete. The athletes are numbered from 1 to 2^n.",

In each pair, the athletes compete against each other, and exactly one of them wins. The winner of each pair advances to the next stage, the athlete who was defeated gets eliminated from the tournament.",
